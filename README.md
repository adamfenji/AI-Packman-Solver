# ðŸ¤– CS4811: Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2023)
This repository documents my work from **CS4811: Artificial Intelligence**, a core upper-level computer science course I completed at **Michigan Technological University**. The class adapted materials and project infrastructure from UC Berkeleyâ€™s **CS188: Artificial Intelligence**. The course introduces foundational concepts in artificial intelligence, including state-space search, adversarial reasoning, constraint satisfaction, logical inference, probabilistic reasoning, and machine learning. The class is hands-on and project-heavy, with each project focusing on a major subarea of AI using the Pac-Man autograder environment.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Completed

| #  | Title                       | Description |
|----|-----------------------------|-------------|
| 1  | **Search**                  | Implemented uninformed and informed search algorithms (DFS, BFS, UCS, A*) to help Pac-Man navigate complex mazes. |
| 2  | **Adversarial Search**     | Built multi-agent Pac-Man agents using **Minimax** and **Expectimax** search strategies, along with evaluation function design. |
| 3  | **Logic**                   | Applied **propositional logic**, **SAT solvers**, and **logical planning** to guide Pac-Man and solve Clue-based logical puzzles. |
| 4  | **Ghostbusters**           | Used **Bayesian inference**, **exact filtering**, and **particle filtering** to track invisible ghosts in noisy environments. |
| 5  | **Reinforcement Learning** | Implemented **Q-Learning**, designed exploration strategies, and analyzed learning agents in unknown environments. |
| 6  | **Machine Learning**       | Built **Naive Bayes** classifiers and **neural networks** from scratch. Extended applications to **digit classification** and **language identification**. |
